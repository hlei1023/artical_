\begin{abstract}
    The control microarchitecture based on the gate model has been proposed in 
    recent research, bridging the gaps between low-level quantum hardware and 
    quantum algorithms. However, In addition to execute quantum application 
    with high issue rate, the implementation of waveform compensation and 
    waveform calibration of quantum gates are also important for a full stack 
    superconducting quantum processor. To this end, we propose and build a 
    prototype of electrode event-based control microarchitecture for superconducting 
    quantum processor. Two core elements of micro-architecture are : 
    i) electrode event based quantum operation unit, 
    ii) hybridÂ quantum circuit description scheme with local and global events. 
    The micro-architecture is implemented with Field Programmable Gate Array. 
    We propose a multi-level compilation scheme to generate microarchitecture 
    executable program.
